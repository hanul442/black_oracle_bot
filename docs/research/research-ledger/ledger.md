## Core lineage rules
Every experiment result links to its research ID. `ADOPT` requires recorded result evidence and implementation scope. `REJECT` preserves the reason; `REVISIT` records the condition for another test. Generated/rejected candidates remain in the trial-family history so multiple-testing diagnostics remain meaningful.

`bo.experiment.v1` remains an **ADOPT-SCHEMA-CANDIDATE** until EXP-DI001 demonstrates replayability. Decision-facing features preserve point-in-time availability/knowledge semantics and, where possible, immutable snapshot identity. Forecast calibration remains separate from alpha performance. AI trace IDs remain BO-canonical with external telemetry as adapters. Agent changes require versioned BO-specific evaluation tasks. Execution assumptions are a versioned model family rather than a single fee scalar.

### Bounded-autonomy rule — Cycle 008
A strategy, Council, router or LLM may propose an order but must not possess authority to bypass deterministic execution safety controls. Live-capable orders must traverse a separately testable pre-trade gate with explicit exposure, loss, freshness, duplication, price/size, instrument/venue and circuit-breaker checks. Gate failures are evidence artifacts linked to the originating decision. Broker/exchange controls are defense-in-depth rather than substitutes for BO-side controls.

### Strategy-property verification rule — Cycle 008
Names such as `market_neutral`, `hedged`, `low_beta` or `defensive` are hypotheses, not evidence. Promotion should separately measure realized exposure/constraint compliance across OOS windows and regimes, and keep that evidence distinct from return performance.

### Failure-domain diversity rule — Cycle 009
Agent-role diversity is not assumed to equal resilience. Council evaluation must record relevant model/provider/data/retrieval/tool dependencies and measure correlated error, false consensus and fault tolerance. Diversity is promotable only when controlled tests show resilience gains net of accuracy, latency, cost, privacy and operational-complexity regressions. Deterministic execution safety remains independent of Council consensus.

### Audit-bundle rule — Cycle 010
Passing controls in isolation is insufficient for promotion. A portfolio-agent candidate should eventually emit one content-addressed `bo.audit_bundle.v1` that references the exact experiment identity, point-in-time certificate, immutable data/evidence snapshot, typed constraints and adherence, execution assumptions/cost sensitivity, agent dependency trace, order-gate evidence where applicable, exposures/turnover, result artifacts and replay pointers. The bundle is a manifest over canonical BO artifacts, not a second ledger. Validator versions and tested invariants must be explicit so a certificate cannot imply checks that were never performed.

### Cross-strategy execution rule — Cycle 011
Strategy sleeves may generate independent immutable order intents, but simultaneous economically offsetting intents should be evaluated for portfolio-level netting before external execution. Netting/coordination is upstream of and cannot bypass `bo.order_gate.v1`. Original intent, coordinated external proposal, sleeve-level virtual allocation and final fill attribution must remain replayable. Simple one-shot netting is the baseline; iterative cost-feedback coordination is a challenger that must demonstrate incremental value net of latency, model risk and operational complexity.

### Agent-authority rule — restored in Cycle 012
Prompt text, retrieved content, web pages, repository text, evidence and tool output are data, not authority. Agent identity, capabilities, resource scope and state-changing permissions must be enforced outside model prompts by deterministic policy. Least privilege and read/write separation are defaults; authorization denials are evidence artifacts. EV-006 remains an independent downstream safety boundary even if an upstream agent is compromised.

### Temporal instrument-identity rule — Cycle 012
Display ticker/symbol is not canonical economic identity. Research and replay should resolve observations through a versioned instrument/listing identity with venue, alias validity interval and knowledge-time provenance. Ambiguous or unresolved mappings must fail closed or remain explicitly unresolved. External identifiers such as FIGI/ISIN/vendor IDs are mappings to BO identity, not unquestioned BO primary keys.

### Evaluator-integrity rule — Cycle 013
An LLM judge score is not self-validating evidence. Whenever a promotion criterion can be checked deterministically or executably, that path takes precedence over probabilistic judging. Non-verifiable criteria require versioned evaluator provenance and BO-domain calibration against hidden human/executable gold where practical. Raw agreement or test-retest consistency alone is insufficient; report chance-corrected agreement and task/rubric-specific error estimates. Preserve raw traces independently of verdicts so runs can be re-judged after evaluator changes. Candidate-authored reasoning is evidence input, not trusted ground truth, and must not be allowed to manipulate the evaluator.

## Current queue
1. **EXP-DI001 + EXP-DI003** — implement minimal `bo.experiment.v1` validator and point-in-time feature manifest; blind-replay a representative KRX experiment with seeded leakage.
2. **EXP-EV006** — implement sandbox-only `bo.order_gate.v1`; replay valid paper orders plus seeded quantity, duplicate, stale-data, outlier-price, loss-limit and retry failures. No live orders.
3. **EXP-EV007** — generate `bo.audit_bundle.v1` on the same KRX fixture; require blind reconstruction plus seeded contamination/constraint/cost/ID-failure detection.
4. **EXP-EV008** — disposable agent/tool sandbox with indirect-prompt-injection and privilege/scope-escape fault injection; no production credentials.
5. **EXP-DI005** — extend the replay harness with canonical-instrument identity fixtures: rename, ticker reuse, venue/share-class ambiguity, delisting/successor and post-hoc mapping correction.
6. **EXP-Q004** — compare independent execution vs one-shot netting on archived/paper multi-strategy intents; only then test iterative coordination.
7. **EXP-DI004** — mutable-source vs snapshot-addressable replay after deliberate source correction.
8. **EXP-EV001 + EXP-Q002** — independent backtest reproducibility and execution-cost stress on the same strategies.
9. **EXP-AIML005 + EXP-EV009 + EXP-AIML006 + EXP-AIML007** — freeze 30–50 BO finance-agent tasks, create a hidden evaluator-calibration subset, baseline the current agent and judge, then ablate Council coordination/common-mode failures only after evaluator validity is measured.
10. **EXP-EV003 / EXP-EV005** — DSR and PBO/CSCV positive/negative controls with complete trial accounting.
11. **EXP-Q003** — verify realized exposure constraints for neutral/hedged candidates; do not adopt external DRL strategy.
12. **EXP-Q001 / EXP-EV004 / EXP-DI002** — calibration, leakage-positive controls and lineage instrumentation.
13. **EXP-AIML002/003/004** — Council/Router trace-replay sandbox.
14. **EXP-D003 + EXP-D004 + EXP-D005 + EXP-D001** — chart semantics/accessibility, progressive disclosure and shared-context UX after core validation infrastructure.
15. **EXP-EV002 / EXP-AIML001** — robustness gate and strategy lineage/redundancy once the validation harness is trustworthy.
16. **Cycle 014 Agent OS PoCs** — after higher-priority validation work, test the skill registry, separated agent memory, bounded browser fallback, HeroUI v3 thin slice and BO-owned Oracle Trace envelope; keep VWAP deviation inside Strategy Factory research only.

## Cycle 013 decision
The cross-domain scan found one new gap worth a separate ID: **EV-009 evaluator integrity**. BO already plans to evaluate agents, Council structures and security traces, but an uncalibrated LLM judge can turn evaluator bias into false architecture evidence. Peer-reviewed ICLR 2026 work establishes that imperfect judges can invalidate naive certification and that calibration-set error estimates can restore statistical validity under stated assumptions. Recent empirical judge studies reinforce that bias and mitigation are model/task dependent. BO will therefore test a layered evaluation stack: deterministic/executable checks first, calibrated probabilistic judging only for non-verifiable criteria, and human escalation for ambiguous/high-disagreement cases.

Recent APort Vault evidence strongly reinforces EV-006/EV-008 deterministic authorization boundaries, so no duplicate security research ID was created. AgentAudit reinforces AIML-005/AIML-004 trace-level evaluation and re-judging rather than requiring a new agent architecture. Design/UX, Quant, Product/Competitor and Data scans produced useful reinforcement but no gap sufficiently distinct from D-001–005, Q-001–004, DI-001–005 or existing validation work to justify ledger inflation.

## Cycle 014 decision
The external-reference scan was intentionally treated as an architecture/reference intake rather than evidence for immediate implementation. Scientific Agent Skills supports a versioned Skill Registry pattern; AgentMemory supports inspectable and separately governed agent memory; Browser Use supports a bounded API-first/browser-fallback execution pattern; HeroUI v3 and design-agent skills support an agent-readable UI workflow; Datadog Agent Observability supports BO-owned trace envelopes with external telemetry adapters; and VWAP deviation is retained only as a Strategy Factory hypothesis pending proper validation.

No new permanent research IDs were minted. The patterns overlap with existing trace/evaluation/dependency/design/validation work, and isolated PoCs should demonstrate a distinct BO gap before the ledger expands. Temporary Cycle 014 PoCs are recorded in `research-ledger/cycle-014.md`: Skill Registry, agent-memory sandbox, browser fallback, HeroUI thin slice, Oracle Trace schema draft, and VWAP-deviation hypothesis testing. None outrank current Foundation Closure and validation infrastructure.

No production trading, paper-trading, credential, connector permission, strategy ranking, model routing or execution behavior was changed.

## Highest-priority next action
Implementation still outranks literature accumulation: execute **EXP-DI001 + EXP-DI003** first on the seeded KRX replay fixture. In the agent-evaluation lane, freeze the AIML-005 golden tasks before testing Council variants, then build the **EV-009 hidden calibration subset and evaluator manifest** so future AIML-006/007 results are not promoted on an unvalidated judge. Cycle 014 remains queued behind these validation foundations.
